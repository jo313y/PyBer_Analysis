It is shown in the Pyber Ride Sharing Data, that there are more rides in the Urban city than in the suburban city and rural city.

It can be shown that the fares for the rural city have the highest range and are on average, higher fares. Suburban has a higher average fare than the city.

## Summary

It isn't surprising that there are more rides in the city than in the rural areas. What is surprising, is the range of fares for the rural areas. Generally it is higher, but it has the highest range of fares as well. It would be a good idea to create an action plan to make sure the price of the rides are more consistent. 

The cost of the fares for the suburban and urban cities are not significantly different. With the data shown, suburban drivers are on average, having a higher fare and are more efficient. It would be a good idea to expand into more suburban areas to increase overall revenue for the company.

The city has the highest number of drivers, which makes sense because of the number of rides. However, the suburban drivers is 60% less than the city and still creates more than half of the total fares than the city. This means there are too many drivers in the city. There may be a need to limit the amount of drivers, or create expectations for the drivers to make sure they are providing the same high quality service throughout the city.
